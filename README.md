# Sitemap XSL Theme

Everyone has wanted to use the themes of the sitemaps that are automatically created in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) plugins on their own website. For this reason, I made a better theme than those sitemaps and presented it to you. You can use it on your websites as you wish.

# Usage

To change the theme of the sitemap, add the following code to the line added in the sample sitemap.xml file. Check that the file location of the style.xsl file is correct.

```xml
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="style.xsl"?>
```

# Note

You can make changes on the theme by changing the CSS codes.
